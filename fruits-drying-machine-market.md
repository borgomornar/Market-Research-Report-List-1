<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fruits Drying Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Atmospheric Drying Machine</li><li>Vacuum Drying Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fruits drying machine market is primarily segmented into atmospheric drying machines and vacuum drying machines. Atmospheric drying machines utilize heat and airflow to remove moisture from fruits at higher temperatures, which often preserves color and flavor but may lead to some nutrient loss. In contrast, vacuum drying machines operate under reduced pressure, lowering the boiling point of water and facilitating gentle drying, which retains more nutrients and enhances flavor. Both types cater to diverse processing needs within the food industry.</p></p>
