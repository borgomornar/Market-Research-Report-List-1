<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld VOC Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld VOC meter market primarily features two types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors. PID meters utilize ultraviolet light to ionize volatile organic compounds, providing highly sensitive detection, ideal for low-level VOC analysis. In contrast, MOS sensors detect VOCs by measuring changes in resistance when gases interact with a metal oxide surface. While PID offers rapid response and precision, MOS sensors are cost-effective and suitable for broader applications, making both vital for environmental monitoring and industrial safety.</p></p>
